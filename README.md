# StudentOutcomePredictor
Predicting students final grade with Keras Deep Learning and a comparison of Machine Learning Models
Understanding the data better with Bayesian Statistics

# Overview
1) The dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. [original dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)
2) Two Portuguese high schools surveyed collected data on students in a Math and a Portuguese language classroom. Features such as demographic, social, home-life and past grades were collected by the schools from students through questionares.  
3) The original study [Cortez and Silva, 2008](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf) used machine learning models.  This project takes the study a step further by using Keras Deep Learning.
4) Bayesian Statistics are used to create a deeper understanding for the impact of life-choices and life's circumstances on student performance.  While it would be unethical for a school to use the ML models for admissions a look at the bayesian statistics from the collected data is ideal for educating families and students on how to improve their likelihood of success.
